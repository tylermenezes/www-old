title: Deploying Software in the Cloud

I recently gave a talk at CodeLabs about modern software deployment, covering containers (Docker),
cloud computing, orchestration, and CI/CD pipelines.

A few students and recent graduates reached out to let me know this was a helpful summary
of information they hadn't gotten in university, so I'm re-sharing here in case it's helpful to
anyone.
