Welcome to my website! There's not much here, you can check out the mostly-accurate
[Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Menezes) for more info.

My [full-time job](https://www.srnd.org/) is getting kids excited about coding in 50+ cities, through events like
CodeDay. For fun, I also produce [Ignite Seattle.](https://igniteseattle.com)

In a past life, I worked directly in technology, including publishing some papers at Microsoft Research Machine Learning
and Applied Statistics, and running a YC and venture-backed startup similar to Periscope (before Periscope).

(The .vc in this domain name means nothing: it was the only TLD available with my first name in 2012.)
