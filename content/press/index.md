Tyler Menezes is the Executive Director at CodeDay, where he works to increase diverse Computer Science enrollment
across North America by inspiring underrepresented students to give coding a try.

Born in Canada but raised in the Pacific Northwest, he briefly attended the University of Washington before
dropping out to start a Y Combinator and venture-backed social video startup in 2011. This, combined with stints
working in machine learning at Microsoft Research and as a programmer at several Seattle startups, led to his work
finding data-driven solutions to increasing CS diversity and enrollment since 2014.

In his free time, Tyler helps run the Projects in CS class at Garfield High School, and organizes the public
speaking event Ignite Seattle.
